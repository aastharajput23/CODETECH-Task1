-**Design Calculator Logic**: Break down the calculator into functions for each operation.<br>
-**Handle User Input**: Take user input for numbers and the desired operation.<br>
-**Perform Calculations**: Execute the appropriate operation based on user choice.<br>
-**Display Results**: Show the result of the calculation to the user.<br>
-**Error Handling**: Validate inputs and handle errors like division by zero.<br>


### Technology used:
-**Python**: Core programming language.<br>
-**Python's Built-in Functions**: input(), print(), and basic arithmetic functions.<br>
-**Control Structures**: if, else, while loop. <br>
